大家好! 我喺Kristy 老師，我喺土生土長嘅香港人。
我移民美國十幾年，但仍心繫香港，希望為傳承廣東話出一分力。

我依家喺德州一所本地非牟利中文學校教授廣東話，亦喺德州中文教師學會會員。
我一直熱忱教學工作，疫情期間，中文學校轉為網課，同時我亦開放私人粵語班。

最近，我開設咗初心童書館網上書店及成立廣東話讀書會，
目的是為美國香港家庭提供一個平台購買港台繁體中文童書，鼓勵親子閱讀學習廣東話。
大家有興趣學習廣東話，歡迎聯絡我。


Hi! I’m Kristy Wong. 
I am a native HongKonger. 
I moved to the States in 2004 and lived in California. 
Currently I am a Cantonese Teacher in Merit Chinese School in Texas. 
I am a member of Chinese Language Teachers Association of Texas. 
I have experience in teaching kindergarten, elementary school kids and teenagers. 
I love to teach young kids and teenagers. 
I volunteered to teach Cantonese in local elementary school in Denton, 
TX when I was the president of Hong Kong Student Association back in the college time. 
During the pandemic, I started to teach Cantonese online classes. 
Recently I also established a Cantonese Book Club and an online bookstore 
promoting Cantonese Story reading in traditional Chinese. 
My goal focus on preserving Cantonese and Hong Kong Culture core value.
