Hi, I am Esther. I moved to Colorado from Hong Kong last year. 
I am experienced in teaching Chinese to people who use Chinese as a second language. 
I used to teach Cantonese and traditional Chinese characters to the lower schoolers 
in Hong Kong who were from Pakistan, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, etc. 
Preserving traditional Chinese characters is one of my goals for their historical and cultural value. 
And I personally think they are elegant and aesthetic. 
I would be more than happy to have an opportunity to teach people who are interested 
in learning Cantonese and traditional Chinese characters.

大家好，我是來自香港的Esther，
很高興有機會在美國認識想學廣東話和繁體字的朋友！
我以前在香港亦有教導少數族裔中文，
他們來自巴基斯坦、印度、菲律賓和印尼等等......
繁體字雖然很難學，
但字型雅觀且有意思，
所以我希望可以將之保存、
世世代代延續下去。
希望在不久的將來能認識更多對廣東話有興趣的朋友！

大家可透過IG聯絡我：milehighdress
