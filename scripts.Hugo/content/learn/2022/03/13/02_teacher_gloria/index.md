Teacher Gloria

I am a professional Chinese educator and an artist in Hong Kong and US, with excellent reputation and experiences taught at famous high schools in Hong Kong for over twenty years teaching Chinese language and History, Chinese Painting and Calligraphy as extra-curricular activities. I received a B.A. Honor Degree and Certificate of Education from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) where I studied Chinese Language, Literature & Culture, History and Fine Arts. I received a Master of Education from the University of Nottingham in the UK, researching Leadership and new methods of teaching Chinese Language in High School. I am now working at the University of Arizona as an Examiner and Tutor of Cantonese (CLP), the Department of Humanities, promote Cantonese Language and Chinese traditional characters. All my undergraduate students are Chinese and foreigners, they can learn Cantonese Pronunciation and Vocabularies, local Colloquialisms, Slang, Idioms and phrases. Medium Instruction of teaching are English and Mandarin.

I was rewarded metals of Chinese Calligraphy in my high school ( True Light Middle School of Hong Kong ).  I continued to train in Chinese Calligraphy and Chinese Painting i.e. Landscape, Free Styles of Flower and Bird. Certifications from my studies in HKU, CUHK and HKfew.org qualified me as a professional artist. Being a devoted painter, I actively participated in various Chinese Arts Exhibitions held in Hong Kong City Hall, Tsuen Wan Town Hall and Shatin City Hall where I was highly regarded, all shown my talents and creativity in Chinese Calligraphy too. 

[My excellent artistic performances in Plum Blossom, Orchids, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo paintings, small pieces of Arts styled in Lingnan Art made me a comprehensive painter. I am the Honorary Life President of Hong Kong Chinese Arts Club ( http://hkcacl.com.hk ). I moved to US in 2013, my mission is to promote hand-painted Chinese Painting and Calligraphy in US and I have a Workshop in Tucson.  ](http://hkcacl.com.hk)

You are welcome to attend my training Zoom classes by individual or small group :

1.Cantonese Course: Cantonese will focus on the reading, writing, listening and speaking skills in Cantonese at the elementary, intermediate to advanced levels while materials will be presented in both Yales or Jyutping (with English translation) and Chinese characters.  

2.Chinese Calligraphy Course: 

The objectives of the course are aiming at giving basic training to students playing active roles to actual Chinese Calligraphy practice and recital. During the workshop, students are encouraged to write Poems in traditional characters that will enhance their reading and writing abilities both in Cantonese speaking.
