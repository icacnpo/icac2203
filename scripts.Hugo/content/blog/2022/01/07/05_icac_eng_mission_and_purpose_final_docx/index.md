Institute of Chinese and Cantonese NPO[a] (abbrev:ICAC) 

The corporation’s mission: 

We are a group of Cantonese speakers who are determined to safeguard the deserved importance  of Cantonese and Traditional Chinese[b] as the world’s unique heritage languages. 

Traditional Chinese can date back the original form of its written characters to the Ancient and Middle Age and is still commonly used nowadays throughout Southeast Asia and many Chinese communities worldwide as their written language. Cantonese is an official spoken language used in the  Southern China Region since the Middle Age period and has been widely used in Hong Kong, Canton Province, as well as the Chinese community in Malaysia, Vietnam, Britain, Canada, Australia  and the USA. Throughout the world, there are still over millions of non-Chinese or non-Cantonese in  all nationalities learning or having the interest to learn Traditional Chinese and Cantonese  through HK songs, movies, operas and literatures. We would like to connect all those concerned  organizations to preserve, inherit and pass on these two treasures of cultural heritage. Recently, the world clearly witnesses a further setback to heritage language preservation that Traditional Chinese and Cantonese have been suppressed since Mandarin and Simplified characters have become Mainland China’s official language. As more and more Chinese and Cantonese people are forced to leave their hometown to non-Chinese nations, there is a surge in the calling for preserving and promoting Traditional Chinese and Cantonese in their new communities and throughout the world. 

In view of a language genocide for so long, there is a strong need of a[c] NPO in the USA to unite all those organizations and individuals in the learning, teaching, and promoting of Traditional Chinese and Cantonese. We therefore find it urgent and legitimate to uphold Traditional Chinese and Cantonese through the setting up of a non-profit organization[d], based in the USA. 

The corporation’s purposes: 

1) to promote Traditional Chinese and Cantonese worldwide 

2) to gather all resources and connect all parties concerned 

3) to educate the [e]Cantonese learners in their own languages 

4) to train the teachers who can use their native languages to teach their own people Cantonese and  Traditional Chinese[f]. 

5) to set up international educational Institutes and Organizations[g] worldwide with the  head office based in the USA
