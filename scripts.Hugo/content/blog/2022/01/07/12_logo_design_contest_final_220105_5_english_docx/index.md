Institute of Chinese And Cantonese (ICAC)


# Calling All Artists to show your creative talent and win a prize!


Logo Design Contest organized by a newly setup NPO in the US.
 
2022 marks the launch of the Institute of Chinese And Cantonese (ICAC, 華粵學院), a nonprofit organization registered in the United States, to preserve and promote Traditional Chinese and Cantonese globally. We need your help to design a distinctive logo that best represents the Institute in all publicity materials and media platforms.
 
Judging criteria that will be employed by a Judging Panel comprising the Board of Directors and founding volunteers of the Institute are:


* Clearly communicate the identity of the Institute*
* Effectively connect with Chinese and non-Chinese around the world
* Distinctly differentiate from existing Chinese schools which mostly teach Simplified characters and Mandarin


* To learn more about the mission and the purpose of the Institute, please visit: 
ICAC Public Group on Facebook   (https://www.facebook.com/groups/498571051409840/permalink/615774799689464/)
The ICAC website is under construction and coming soon.
