CEO Letter       2022. 04      Kwai Chu So

“One monk totes a tank of water for drinking, three monks have no water to drink!” This is a profound Chinese story and proverb that we probably could recollect.  It shows unity can be harmonious and advantageous. Unity is strength!  

ICAC has entered a team building stage at its third month of operations.  Teamwork is essential to success.  We do not take it lightly! The 7 volunteer groups are working at their own pace to get the projects done.  Among the 30+ volunteers including 7 group leaders, there are some who are actively participating and some are taking a wait-and-see approach.  There were also a few who volunteered with us briefly and decided to quit. Things happen!  It is completely understandable. Path is not always smooth but no matter what we will strive towards our common goal.

The three founding directors are serving ICAC wholeheartedly.  With mutual respect, trust and support, we work hard until we reach a consensus decision making. I am particularly grateful to the other 2 founding directors who entrusted me with the management of ICAC and authorized me to execute all of the Board’s decisions. This is such a tremendous responsibility. I accept the challenge knowing that I have their full support.

During the past 4 months, ICAC has fulfilled various federal/state registrations and necessary legal organizational requirements in connection with operating a nonprofit entity in the U.S., without paying anyone for the services.  We, together with the help of unpaid volunteers, worked diligently and cautiously to strictly adhere to federal and local laws and regulations.  ICAC is now a registered nonprofit entity that can legally accept public monetary donations.  We have submitted a 501(c)3 tax exempt application and are eagerly hoping for a favorable determination letter from IRS. Volunteers are a valued part of ICAC’s success. Success is almost literally impossible unless there is teamwork involved. There is a Chinese saying: "If our hearts are joined together, we can even move the Mount Tai! " A big salute from the Board of Directors to our dear volunteers who make our work successful.

After the completion of volunteer registration and an all-hands meeting, ICAC has implemented a code of conduct policy for all directors, officers and volunteers to follow. What comes next is to (i) connect with newly recruited volunteers and mobilize individual groups to plan out future projects; (ii) reach out to and collaborate with other nonprofits that share common objectives; and (iii) actively seeking for a suitable premises to use as ICAC’s school facilities. Work on ongoing projects is in full swing, there is no time to lose......

“一個和尚挑水飲, 三個和尚沒水飲！”

華粵學院在成立後第三個月已經踏入團隊建立階段，同心即事成，反之則事敗！不可掉以輕心！

現在七個小組各施各職，當然有強有弱，有快有慢。卅多位義工中也有積極參與，仍在觀望或極速離開的，七位組長中也有全力以赴或因事忙而有心無力的，但這些都不要緊，我們已全速啟動， 無論有多少義工全情投入，我們不會稍停！

慶幸三位創會董事完全同心，全部議決全數通過或繼續討論至獲得一致意見才通過，因為我們深信同心就事成，而且大家互相尊重﹑信任及支持。本人也感激他們委以重用，授權本人執行董寧局一切決定及管理華粵學院整個三十多人的大團隊，責任重大卻責無旁貸，無償卻饒有意義。

經過四個月的各項註冊及各項文件呈交工作，華粵學院在沒有受薪員工及沒支付一分一毫專業服務費下，獨力完成美國政府要求的各項申請程序及法律文件。我們不單已註冊為美國非營利組織，可接受捐款， 而且已遞交非營利組織捐款免稅申請，一切都已按步就班，緊跟美國法例要求完成，全賴多位義工積極協助，在繁忙的個人工作和生活中還為華粵學院默默付出。 古語有云：“人心齊， 泰山移！” 在此謹代表董事局向各位功臣致敬！

義工登記﹑製訂成員守則及全體成員大會後，謹接的是與個別新義工聯繫及與各組長密斟，舉行小組會，傾談未來工作，主動聯絡各組織，實地觀察可供使用的未來院址，一切正如火如荼，快馬加鞭.....
