### **華粵學院（美國註册非營利組織）**

##### **組織使命**


我們是一羣以粵語為母語的人，致力捍衛正體中文和粵語（下面間中簡稱華粵），傳承這些獨特的語言遺產。

當今正體中文可溯源至古代到中古時期，至今仍為東南亞及世界各地華人社區廣泛使用的書寫語言。粵語也是由這時期開始成為中國南方的官方語言，一直在香港、廣東地區以至馬來西亞、越南、英國、加拿大和美國的華人社區普遍採用。全球估計有過百萬不同國籍的非華人或非廣東人透過香港流行歌曲、電影、舞臺劇和文學等學習正體中文和粵語。故此，我們計劃聯繫所有相關組織，竭力把這兩項寳貴語言文化遺產保存、推廣和傳遞下去。世界有目共睹，當中國大陸將普通話和簡體字變成官方語言後，正體中文和粵語遭受打壓，傳統語言的保育工作飽受更嚴峻的挫折。由於越來越多華人、廣東人及香港人被逼離鄉別井，流散到非華語國家，所以，在自己的社區以至全世界，號召保護和傳承正體中文與粵語，實在有燃眉之急。

鍳於自古沿用至今的語言面臨滅絕，亟需一個非營利機構來團結所有相關組織和個別人仕，於教授及推動華粵方面發揮更深遠影響，所以，我們認為有逼切需要和充份理據，成立一個以美國為基地的非營利機構來保衛正體中文和粵語。

### **Institute of Chinese and Cantonese NPO (ICAC)**

##### **The corporation’s mission:**

We are a group of Cantonese speakers who are determined to safeguard the deserved importance  of Traditional Chinese and Cantonese as the world’s unique heritage languages.

Traditional Chinese can date back the original form of its written characters to the Ancient and Middle Age and is still commonly used nowadays throughout Southeast Asia and many Chinese communities worldwide as their written language. Cantonese is an official spoken language used in the  Southern China Region since the Middle Age period and has been widely used in Hong Kong, Canton Province, as well as the Chinese community in Malaysia, Vietnam, Britain, Canada, Australia  and the USA. Throughout the world, there are still over millions of non-Chinese or non-Cantonese in  all nationalities learning or having the interest to learn Traditional Chinese and Cantonese  through HK songs, movies, operas and literatures. We would like to connect all those concerned  organizations to preserve, inherit and pass on these two treasures of cultural heritage. Recently, the world clearly witnesses a further setback to heritage language preservation that Traditional Chinese and Cantonese have been suppressed since Mandarin and Simplified characters have become Mainland China’s official language. As more and more Chinese and Cantonese people are forced to leave their hometown to non-Chinese nations, there is a surge in the calling for preserving and promoting Traditional Chinese and Cantonese in their new communities and throughout the world.

In view of a language genocide for so long, there is a strong need of an NPO in the USA to unite all those organizations and individuals in the learning, teaching, and promoting of Traditional Chinese and Cantonese. We therefore find it urgent and legitimate to uphold Traditional Chinese and Cantonese through the setting up of a non-profit organization, based in the USA.

##### **The corporation’s purposes:**

to promote Traditional Chinese and Cantonese worldwide

to gather all resources and connect all parties concerned

to educate  Cantonese learners in their own languages

to train the teachers who can use their native languages to teach their own people Traditional Chinese and Cantonese

to set up international educational institutes and organizations worldwide with the head office based in the USA
