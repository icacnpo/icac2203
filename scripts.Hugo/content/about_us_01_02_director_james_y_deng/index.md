* 我有半導體碩士學位，目前任供職於美國高科技公司, 設計核輻射監測設備。
我家庭的苦難始於祖輩1949年從香港返回內地。
感謝神，我於家族遭受持續五代的逼害後，還有命逃到美國。
當蘇老師帶頭站出來，希望保存正體中文及粵語，
我說， “Yes. Let's go”。
前路艱難，共勉。

* I hold a master degree in semiconductor. 
I currently work in a high-tech company designing nuclear radiation monitoring equipment in the USA. 
My family began experiencing tribulations in 1949 when my ancestors returned to the Mainland 
from Hong Kong. Thank God for sparing my clan.
I am so blessed to escape to the USA after five generations of ceaseless persecution from CCP.

* When Ms. So spearheaded the idea to preserve Traditional Chinese and Cantonese, 
I immediately asserted to her, “Yes. Let’s go.” 
Let’s have each other’s back despite a tough journey ahead.
