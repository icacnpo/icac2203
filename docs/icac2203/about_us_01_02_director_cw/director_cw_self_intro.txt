董事局成員簡介

我生於香港，在新界一條小鄉村長大，雖然以廣東話為母語，但身處的語言環境真可說是百花齊放，百家爭鳴。

因父輩是客家人，村內的客家人亦甚多，耳濡目染之下，總能學到一點客家話。

在學校上英語課是必然了，但更有趣的經歷來自村內的一所女修道院，修女來自五湖四海，除香港外，有來自澳門，日本，越南，法國，意大利.... 除了本國的語言外，她們都說法語，或在努力學習。

從两百年前的小渔村到今天的大都會，我的家鄉從來是個華洋雜處，自由開放的地方，不同的種族，語言，思潮..... 都能在這土地上生根茁壯... 我們今天流散海外，仍堅持講廣東話，寫正體字，就是對家鄉的一份思念，為生活添加動力，向光明的前路奮進。


Self-introduction of Director CW

I was born in Hong Kong and grew up in a small village in the New Territories. Although I speak Cantonese as my native language, the language environment I lived in can be described as “a hundred kinds of flowers blossom” and “a hundred schools of thought contend”

Since the mother tongue of my father's family is Hakka, and there were many Hakka people in the village, I could always learn a little Hakka dialect from interacting with them.

Learning English at school was inevitable, but a more interesting experience came from a Convent in the village. The nuns in the Convent came from all over the world: Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Vietnam, France, Italy. In addition to their national languages, they all spoke French or were studying hard.

From a small fishing village two hundred years ago to today's metropolis, my hometown has always been a mixed and free place of different races, languages, thoughts where we rooted and grew up. Today, although we are scattered around the world overseas, we still insist on speaking Cantonese and writing Traditional Chinese, which is an expression of missing our hometown, adding motivation to our struggling in life, and forging ahead towards a brighter future.
