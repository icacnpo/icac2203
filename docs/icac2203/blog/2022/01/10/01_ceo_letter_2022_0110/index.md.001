### __一間非營利組織的誕生-華粵學院__

* 我從事兩文三語教育及培訓30多年，在2019年前已有志把正體中文及廣東話（華粵）在全球傳揚開去。雖然我嘅學生已來自五大州，我已做到這點，但我能接觸的人數不竟有限。

* 2019年是關鍵的一年，深感承傳華粵悠久文化之重任已逼在眉睫，遂毅然於2021，拋下香港，單人入美，積極於各網上志同道合的群組找尋有志者合作。皇天不負有心人，與James素未謀面，他竟二話不說，出錢出力。我哋二人開始籌組非營利組織所需事項，但難題來了，最基本要求的三位董事（director）仍未湊夠。義工團中未有另一人選，但在不斷搜尋中發現美國註冊公司的董事不限於居美人士，於是立即再聯絡在港已幫我籌辦廣東話的志華，他也無懼一切，即時答允，非營利組織基本團隊已成，我哋旋即展開一連串繁複的申請步驟，每項程序不假手於人，全部由一班不懂美國法例的志願人士，按當地法例逐字逐項去仔細研究、查詢、請教後進行。華粵學院經大半年由一人孕育而終於1月1日正式成立。我們在財力及人手資源欠奉的處境下，絲毫不敢怠慢，同心火速行動。甫成立，組織已與美國、英國、加拿大及香港多個相關團隊及個別熱心人士面談、電話與文字聯絡及網上會議，獲得各地組織主動給予寶貴意見、轉發組織資訊及代為宣傳。於此網站公開之時，正萬事俱備，只欠你的參與。請加入我們，無論是捐贈者、讀者、網友、義工、教師、家長、學生、委員會委員，甚至董事，齊來支持正體中文及粵語，開闢另一條國際線。

### **Letter from CEO    2022.01        Kwai Chu So**

The birth of  a nonprofit organization-Institute of Traditional Chinese And Cantonese (ICAC)

I have been devoting myself to trilingual education and training for over thirty years. I have desired to promote Traditional Chinese and Cantonese to the world long before 2019. Although my students are coming from five different Continents which somewhat fulfills my desire, the number I can reach is still very limited. 

2019 is a critical year. I strongly feel burdened by the urgent need to preserve the long-established culture and language treasure presented in Traditional Chinese and Cantonese. I therefore resolutely left Hong Kong alone for the US. Upon arrival, I actively searched online for like-minded people to collaborate with me. By the grace of God, James agreed instantly even though we never met before. He contributed money, time and effort. When we began working on the requirements for establishing a nonprofit organization, we were hit by the first problem. We were unable to meet the minimum requirement of three directors. No one in the volunteer team was available to take the role. After tireless investigation, we delightedly discovered that a director of a US registered company is not required to live in the US. I immediately reached out to Chi Wah who has helped me organize Cantonese education in Hong Kong before I left. He promised right away without a single concern. A founding team of a nonprofit organization was formed. 

We, a group of layman with no knowledge of the US jurisdiction, went through every step of the registration process all on our own. To overcome the legal insufficiency and make sure we commit no mistakes, we carefully studied the clauses and made thorough inquiries before taking actions. After three-quarters of a year of hard work, ICAC, originally conceived by a person, was formally established on January 1st, 2022. Under a circumstance where financial and human resources were lacking, we dared not to neglect a bit but swiftly acted in a unified way. Upon its establishment, the Institute has already connected with many related organizations or teams and individual enthusiasts in the US, the UK, Canada and Hong Kong. We communicated face-to-face, over the phone and via correspondence and online videoconference. We received great support from different organizations, including offering valuable advice, sharing ICAC’s information and promoting ICAC on our behalf. Now that our website is launched, everything is ready but your participation. 

No matter what role you want to play, donors, readers, netizens, volunteers, teachers, students, committee members and even directors, please come and join us to support Traditional Chinese and Cantonese. Let us open up another international front line to fight for what we deeply value.
