Hi, I am Esther. I moved to Colorado from Hong Kong last year. I am experienced in teaching Chinese to people who use Chinese as a second language. I used to teach Cantonese and traditional Chinese characters to the lower schoolers in Hong Kong who were from Pakistan, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, etc. Preserving traditional Chinese characters is one of my goals for their historical and cultural value. And I personally think they are elegant and aesthetic. I would be more than happy to have an opportunity to teach people who are interested in learning Cantonese and traditional Chinese characters.
